- no leading `compass_` whenever possible

# include headers

Include in the following order:

1. The prototype/interface header for this implementation (ie, the .h/.hh file that corresponds to this .cpp/.cc file).
2. Other headers from the same project, as needed.
3. Headers from other non-standard, non-system libraries (eg, Qt, Eigen, etc).
4. Headers from other "almost-standard" libraries (eg, Boost)
5. Standard C++ headers (eg, iostream, functional, etc)
6. Standard C headers (eg, cstdint, dirent.h, etc)
